A presentation website written with the python web framework django &amp; java script  frontend React. The site will host products as well as the capability to make request for handmade furniture 



## How to...

1. Create a virtual enviorment to encapsulate all FurnitureWebSite dependencies in one virtual machine

   Install virtaulenv through pip package manager:

   `sudo pip install virtualenv`

   Create a virtaul enviroment special directory
 
   `mkdir virt_env`

   Generate the virtual enviorment...

   `virtualenv virt_env/FurnitureVirt --no-site-packages --verbose`
 

   Activate the enviroment...

   `source virt_env/FurnitureVirt/bin/activate`


   To deactivate it write..
 
   `deactivate`

2. Install the requierd dependencies

   First make sure the virtualenv is activated ( a FurnitureVirt tag name should appear in paranthesis a the start of shell command line in 
left corner)

   `pip install -r pipackage/requierments.txt`  

   Now you should have a fully functional enviroment with all the dependencies installed.
